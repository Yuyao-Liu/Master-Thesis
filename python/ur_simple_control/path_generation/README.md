The path planning algorithms have been developed
by Albin Dahlin, both theoretically and in implementation.
The details can be found in Albin's [PhD thesis](https://research.chalmers.se/publication/538686/file/538686_Fulltext.pdf).
The code has been slightly reworked to fit into the library,
but this will be re-done so that it works without reworks, and we can
just submodule these repos to here.
Alternatively we can talk to Albin and see how much he cares about maintaining his code.
