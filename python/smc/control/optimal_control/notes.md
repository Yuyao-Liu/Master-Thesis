## goal
-----------
use crocoddyl to compute a whole trajectory in advance.
the trajectory can be followed with some other controller,
with controls here being feed-forward or whatever

## alternative, easier for students
-------------------------------------
is to use casadi with pinocchio.casadi
as it's way more transparent.
examples of this stack are available in tutorials, hopefully they map
it to Simple Manipulator Control themselves
